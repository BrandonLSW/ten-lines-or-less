# Ten Lines or Less
## FoxDot mini jams in 10 lines of code (or less)

I'm creating a body of work created in FoxDot of snippets of code that maybe didn't become a full piece and can be used by others as a learning tool or inspiration for their own work using FoxDot. I'll try and use as many different facets of the program so show how they can all fit together easily.

Please feel free to download, edit, share, whatever!
